## Environment Requirements

In order to set up your development environment it is recommended that the following are installed on your machine:

- Composer
- PHP v8.2
- NPM v10.2.3

Alternately if this is not a practical solution (for example on a Windows machine) you can implement 
[Devilbox](http://devilbox.org/), or similar, container for local development

## Getting Started

In order to set up your development environment you should simply need to run the following commands:

```shell
php artisan serve
php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run dev
```
